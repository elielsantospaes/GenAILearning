**Summary and Analysis of the Introduction**

The introduction discusses the recent advancements in massive self-supervised language models, such as GPT-3, and their potential to achieve task-agnostic artificial intelligence. However, it highlights the limitations of current methods for controlling these models to perform specific tasks. The authors argue that new methods are required to properly evaluate their capabilities and extract useful work from these models.

**Main Points:**

1. **Limitations of current methods**: The authors argue that fine-tuning, a standard approach prior to GPT-3, is limited, and few-shot prompting, used by GPT-3, is not truly "learning" the task during runtime.
2. **Task location vs. task learning**: The authors propose that few-shot prompting is primarily used for task location, where the model is guided to perform a task it has already learned, rather than learning the task from the few-shot examples.
3. **Prompt programming**: The authors suggest exploring more general methods of prompt programming, specifically techniques for communicating task intention and structure to a self-supervised model using natural language.
4. **Natural language semiotics**: The authors propose that interacting with language models should be done from the perspective of natural language as it is used by humans, and that prompts should be designed to elicit the desired response from a human.
5. **New approaches**: The authors introduce the concept of metaprompt programming, where the language model is used to generate task-specific prompts, and propose incorporating these ideas into existing and future benchmarks.

**References Used:**

1. **[3]**: The original GPT-3 paper, titled "Language models are few-shot learners," which is referenced to support the discussion on few-shot prompting and the limitations of current methods.
2. **[12]**: A reference to a previous work that used fine-tuning on a portion of a task dataset, which is mentioned as a standard approach prior to GPT-3.

**Analysis:**

The introduction provides a clear and concise overview of the limitations of current methods for controlling massive self-supervised language models. The authors' argument that few-shot prompting is primarily used for task location rather than task learning is well-supported by the reference to the original GPT-3 paper. The proposal to explore more general methods of prompt programming and the introduction of metaprompt programming are interesting and potentially significant contributions to the field. The use of natural language semiotics as a lens for designing prompts is also a promising approach. Overall, the introduction effectively sets the stage for the rest of the paper, which is expected to delve deeper into the proposed methods and their applications.The provided text is an excerpt from a research article discussing the concept of "prompt programming" for autoregressive language models, specifically GPT-3. The authors explore the challenges and methodologies for crafting effective prompts to elicit desired behavior from these models.

**Main Points:**

1. **The dynamics of language**: The authors argue that understanding how to prompt an autoregressive language model requires considering the context in which it was trained and the function it approximates. GPT-3 was trained on a massive corpus of natural language, and its performance is a result of approximating the underlying dynamics of language.
2. **Prompt programming as a form of natural language programming**: The authors propose that prompt programming can be viewed as a form of programming in natural language, which is indeterministic and complex. They discuss the difficulties of crafting effective prompts and the need for a methodology to guide this process.
3. **Methods for task specification**: The authors present several methods for task specification, including:
	* **Direct task specification**: constructing a signifier for the task, such as using the name of the task or a compound description.
	* **Task specification by demonstration**: using few-shot examples to demonstrate the task.
	* **Task specification by memetic proxy**: using analogies or proxies to convey the task, such as referencing a well-known figure or character.
4. **Constraining behavior**: The authors discuss the importance of constraining the behavior of the language model to elicit the desired response. They propose using techniques such as adding context, using specific formatting, and creating syntactical constraints to guide the model's output.
5. **Serializing reasoning**: The authors discuss the need to allow language models to perform serial reasoning, particularly for tasks that require complex problem-solving. They propose using techniques such as step-by-step procedures, self-criticism, and elaborating on the question to facilitate this process.
6. **Metaprompt programming**: The authors introduce the concept of metaprompt programming, which involves using a higher-level prompt to generate a specific prompt for a task. They demonstrate the use of metaprompts to facilitate serial reasoning and task-specific prompting.
